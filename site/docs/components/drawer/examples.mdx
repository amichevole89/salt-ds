### Default

By default, a drawer anchors to the `left` edge of the screen and has `variant="primary"`.
Set `variant="secondary"` for a secondary drawer.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="Position" >

### Position

You can place drawer on the `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` edges using the `position` prop.

#### Best practices

- Use top drawer to display information best displayed in horizontal format, e.g., complex filters or a summary panel.
- Use bottom drawer for any master-detail layout containing graphs and images.
- Use right drawer to show supporting information, notifications or quick settings.

### Right drawer usage example

Consider using a right-anchored drawer to show supporting information related to the current context, such as recent events, notifications or quick settings. Always set your drawer's width suitable for the content inside it.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="TopDrawerUsageExample" >

### Top drawer usage example

Anchor your drawer to the top edge if it will display supporting information thatâ€™s related to the current context and is best presented in a horizontal format, e.g., complex filters or a summary panel.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="BottomDrawerUsageExample" >

### Bottom drawer usage example

Anchor a drawer to the bottom edge of the screen when using a master-detail layout with content, such as graphs, images or comparisons that requires a wider horizontal format.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="OptionalCloseAction" >

### Optional close action

This example closes when the user clicks the **Submit** button instead of closing with the drawer's optional close button.
When present, the close button always appears on the top right corner of the drawer, it's sticky and doesn't scroll.

In certain use cases, i.e., when user needs to complete form fields, an alternative action such as a 'submit and close' button, would be more appropriate than a close button.
