### Default

Drawers are by default, anchored to the `left` edge of the screen but can also be placed to the `right`, `top` and `bottom` edges using `position` prop.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="DefaultSecondary" >

### Default Secondary

By default, the drawer is displayed on the left if the `position` prop is not set. Set `variant="secondary"` for secondary drawer.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="RightWithFormField" >

### Right drawer with form field

Set `position="right"` to display the drawer component on the right. Consider using a right-anchored drawer to show supporting information that’s related to the current context, such as recent events, notifications or quick settings.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="TopWithFormField" >

### Top drawer with form field

Set `position="top"` to display the drawer component at the top. Anchor your drawer to the top edge if it will display supporting information that’s related to the current context and is best presented in a horizontal format, e.g., complex filters or a summary panel.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="BottomNoCloseButton" >

### Bottom drawer with optional close button

Set `position="bottom"` to display the drawer component at the bottom. Drawer's close button is optional and can be added as and when desired. Anchor a drawer to the bottom edge of the screen when using a master-detail layout with content—such as a graphs, images or comparisons that requires a wider horizontal format.
