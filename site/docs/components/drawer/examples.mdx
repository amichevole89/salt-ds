### Default primary

Drawers are by default, anchored to the `left` edge of the screen. You can also place them on the `right`, `top` and `bottom` edges using `position` prop.

### Right drawer with form field

Set `position="right"` to display the drawer component on the right.

#### Best practices

Consider using a right-anchored drawer to show supporting information that’s related to the current context, such as recent events, notifications or quick settings.

### Top drawer with form field

Set `position="top"` to display the drawer component at the top. Anchor your drawer to the top edge if it will display supporting information that’s related to the current context and is best presented in a horizontal format, e.g., complex filters or a summary panel.

### Bottom drawer with optional close button

Set `position="bottom"` to display the drawer component at the bottom. The drawer's close button is optional and you can add it as and when desired. Anchor a drawer to the bottom edge of the screen when using a master-detail layout with content, such as graphs, images or comparisons that requires a wider horizontal format.
