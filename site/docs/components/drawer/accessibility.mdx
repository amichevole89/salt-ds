### Best practices

- When open, drawer's close button (if present) or the first interactive element always receives initial focus.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- If focus is on the trigger element, this action activates the element and opens drawer. Focus remains within the drawer content.
- If focus is on close button, this action closes the drawer. Focus returns to trigger element.
- If focus is in the drawer, this action closes the drawer if a content element is configured to close the overlay when activated.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is on close button, Tab moves focus through focusable content elements in drawer.
- If focus is on the last element in the overlay content, Tab wraps focus to the close button. Focus does not leave the drawer.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is on close button, this action moves focus to last focusable content element in the drawer.
- If focus is on the first interactive element in the drawer, this action wraps focus to the close button. Focus does not leave the drawer.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Escape">

- If focus is in the drawer, Escape closes the drawer and returns focus to trigger element.
