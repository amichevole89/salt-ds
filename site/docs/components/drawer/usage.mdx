### Using the component

Use a drawer to reveal additional functionality or information that is contextual to content on-screen, but which can be closed when not required.

Salt's drawer is always modal. When open, the drawer displays a visual overlay, also known as a [`Scrim`](/salt/components/scrim), over the underlying content.

### When to use

- When you need additional content, such as a form or sidebar navigation, to be displayed in a specific area of the screen.

### When not to use

- For [UITK Inlaid Drawer](https://uitk.gaiacloud.jpmchase.net/build/components/drawer#inlaid-drawer) equivalent, use [`BorderLayout`](../border-layout).
- For [docked drawer](https://uitk.gaiacloud.jpmchase.net/build/components/drawer#docked-drawer), create the component using [`Panel`](/salt/components/panel) and styles to expand and collapse a non-modal surface.
