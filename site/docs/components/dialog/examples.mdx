    <LivePreview componentName="dialog" exampleName="Default" >
      ### Default

      The dialog displays with a title, content area, and action bar. The component is modal, meaning it prevents interaction with the rest of the UI while open and must be addressed by clicking one of the action buttons or dismissing with the close button. If the content of the dialog extends beyond the end of the screen, the `DialogContent` area will become scrollable.

     <LivePreview componentName="dialog" exampleName="Sizes" >
    ### Sizes

    - Dialog consists of 3 responsive modal sizes: small, medium and large. The size at which to display a dialog depends on the amount of modal content you have. The widths of all three dialog size types are responsive to the Salt breakpoints. This ensures dialogs appear larger within smaller viewport sizes for ease of visibility.
    - Typically, small dialogs are used for simple alerts, quick selections or confirmations that require either zero or quick actions from the user. Medium dialogs contain additional components or layouts such as grouped preferences that require increased user input. Large dialogs usually contain more complex layouts and can display a series of tasks to complete, such as a form within a wizard.

    ### Accent

    For default dialogs, you can pass the `accent` prop to `DialogTitle` which accepts a boolean to render an accent bar in the title of the dialog. You cannot render the accent bar when a status is also being rendered.
