The Salt design system enables teams to modify design variables and theme projects to their requirements. Understanding how Salt structures and manages these design variables will help you create consistent themes for your project.

## Why theme?

Theming enables you to modify design variables, such as color or opacity, in a simple and consistent way. While you can override such variables on a component-by-component basis, following Salt's structure offers several benefits:

- Streamlined design changes that automatically apply to related components
- Increased consistency across all components, improving the overall user experience
- Simplified, drag-and-drop approach when adding new components or patterns 
- Single reference points for commonly-used values

Note that theming may involve an element of maintenance, and future versions of Salt may not work with existing themes as expected.

## Tokens explained

Salt uses design tokens to store decisions in a single place.
