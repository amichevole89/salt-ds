The Salt design system enables teams to modify design variables and theme projects to their requirements. Understanding how Salt structures and manages these design variables will help you create consistent themes for your project.

Below we'll explain what a token is, how different token layers interact, and how this structure makes theming more accessible.

## Theming with tokens

Salt's approach to theming enables you to modify design variables, such as color or opacity, in a simple and consistent way.

Salt uses tokens to store design decisions. Components can reuse tokens, meaning they help to define the design rules and aid the cohesiveness of the overall user interface.

Instead of overriding design variables within a single component, we recommend modifying the tokens that the component references. Maintaining this token-based structure offers several benefits:

- Streamlined design changes that automatically apply to related components
- Increased consistency across all components, improving the overall user experience
- Simplified, drag-and-drop approach when adding new components or patterns
- Single reference points for commonly-used values

Note that theming will involve an element of maintenance as future versions of Salt may modify the token list.

## Token tiers

Salt's tokens are organized into three tiers. From most generalized to most specific, the tiers are:

1. Foundational tokens
2. Palette tokens
3. Characteristic design tokens

These tokens can reference each other and inherit values from lower tiers.

Take the status characteristic tokens as an example. Components like [`Toast`](/salt/components/toast/examples) use these tokens to denote status using color, such as a green foreground color to denote success.

1. The component uses the `--salt-status-success-foreground` characteristic token. This token has the default value `var(--salt-palette-success-foreground)`.
2. The characteristic token references the palette token `--salt-palette-success-foreground`. This token has the default value `var(--salt-color-green-400)`.
3. The palette token references the foundational token `--salt-color-green-400`. This token has the default value `rgb(48, 156, 90)`.

Characteristics are both light/dark and density sensitive. That means the value the characteristic points to will change according to the values given in the nearest `SaltProvider`.

As an example, `--salt-actionable-primary-background` resolves to `var(--salt-palette-interact-primary-background)`. In the light theme, this palette token has the value `var(--salt-color-gray-60)`. In the dark theme, the value is `var(--salt-color-gray-300)`. Foundational tokens then resolve to their respective RGBA values.

## Using tokens to theme

At this stage in Salt's development, we recommend you only modify the characteristic tokens. Salt is under active development and tokens are subject to change, but the characteristic token layer is likely to experience the fewest changes.

We strongly recommend you don't change the foundational tokens. This can cause unexpected issues, such as breaking contrast levels or changing the size of components.

It's best to store theme changes in a single override file, rather than duplicating the entire project to make changes. This will simplify the development process.
